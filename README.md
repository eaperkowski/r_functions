# R helper functions

This is a repo to store helper functions that may or may not be useful. List of functions and their purpose:

  - # temp_standardize: standardizes Vcmax, Jmax, and Rd estimates to single temperature. Vcmax and Jmax are temperature standardized using a modified Arrhenius function as explained in Kattge & Knorr (2007), while Rd is temperature standardized using a log polynomial from O'Sullivan (2013) and parameters set using Heskel et al. (2016). Function is capable of standardizing to any temperature.
